  ## Installation
  Initiate a clone or pull of a project's repo onto your local machine, then change directories through terminal to the illbehonest directory. 
  You will need to initiate package dependencies with the following command:
  > npm install 
  The dependencies should automatically install for you, but you will need to configure certain ones to utilize, such as dotenv and MySQL.

  ## Usage
  To set-up Dotenv, please refer to instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
  Be sure to have a MySQL user set-up. Utilize the following commands afterwards:
  > mysql -u root -p
  This will prompt for a MySQL password associated to you.
  You should see "mysql >" waiting for input.
  > source db/schema.sql;
  This will create the database.
  > show databases;
  This will show a list of your databases, you are specifically looking for "illbehonest_db".
  > quit
  This will exit MySQL.
  Type the following: 
  > npm run seeds
  This command generates the database with the sample seed data from the "seeds" folder if you'd like to see the website fully functional.
  You may start the server in two ways:
  > npm run watch
  or 
  > npm start
  To close the server, navigate out of Insomnia back to the terminal window and execute the following command:
  > CTRL+C
  > Y
  This will end the server connection.
